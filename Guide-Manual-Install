go to https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamCMD
install relevant SteamCMD version for your operating system ~note this guide is for linux debian based systems
then go to https://valheim.fandom.com/wiki/Valheim_Dedicated_Server and ignore all of their scripts



installing the steam tool:
Note:
    the steam tool only needs to be downloaded for the game files this will not prevent you playing the game on the same account
install steam 
login to your account

right click on it to browse local files and put the scripts listed below in the correct places


in valheim.sh ? might be start_server.sh you will need the following script :

  export templdpath=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH  
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./linux64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH  
  export SteamAppID=892970

  echo "Starting server PRESS CTRL-C to exit"  
  ./valheim_server.x86_64 -name "<Philip>" -port 2456 -nographics -batchmode -world "<Philip1>" -password "you dont need these <> for the password" -public 1  
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$templdpath

  #notes you can find in the valheim dedicated server directory under start_server.sh that script doesnt dogshit work tho but its useful to know the passowrd requirements and the ports needed
  # Tip: Make a local copy of this script to avoid it being overwritten by steam.
  # NOTE: Minimum password length is 5 characters & Password cant be in the server name.
  # NOTE: You need to make sure the ports 2456-2458 is being forwarded to your server through your local router & firewall.
  
  installupdate.sh:
  in InstallUpdate.sh you will need the following script:
  steamcmd +@sSteamCmdForcePlatformType linux +force_install_dir /path/to/server +login anonymous +app_update 896660 validate +quit #!/bin/sh
  
Tip:
  run the InstallUpdate.sh file everytime the game updates make sure to exit your server before running this

  
  
  ~to do this you may have to stop the server and restart it for it to generate the new world file and then do this 
  if you want to carry over a world from one computer to another i would reccomend changing the name of the world in the start_server.sh 
  file to something that nothing else will be called on your computer like a name and then using a search command such as:
  sudo find / -name 'put the name here'
  
  mine was in a root directory because the Steam user is root for me
